### 3.2 Model Training of SRNet

Run the train program on the collected measurements to reconstruct hyperspectral images in pytorch platform.

● First, download the training dataset of HyperspecI-V1 (400-1000 nm ) into ` ./Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1000/HSI_all/` , and the training dataset of HyperspecI-V2 (400-1700 nm ) into ` ./Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1700/HSI_all/` . 

● Second, run `SplitDataset.py` to partition the training data and validate, with 90% allocated for training and 10% for validation. 

The details  operations for HyperspecI-V1 dataset partition :

```python
python SplitDataset.py --data_folder './Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1000/HSI_all/' --train_folder './Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1000/Train/' --test_folder './Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1000/Valid/' 
```

The details  operations for HyperspecI-V2 dataset partition :

```python
python SplitDataset.py --data_folder './Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1700/HSI_all/' --train_folder './Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1700/Train/' --test_folder './Dataset_Train/HSI_400_1700/Valid/' 
```



● Third, the training programs are executed to train the spectral reconstruction model. 

For training HyperspecI-V1,  execute the following command in the terminal, and the training results will be saved in the ` ./exp/HyperspecI_V1/` folder.

```python
python train_HyperspecI_V1.py 
```

For training HyperspecI-V2,  execute the following command in the terminal, and the training results will be saved in the ` ./exp/HyperspecI_V2/` folder.

```python
python train_HyperspecI_V2.py 
```



### 3.3 Test hyperspectral reconstruction results in real-world scenes

Run the test program on the collected images to reconstruct hyperspectral images in pytorch platform.

(1) When the images were collected using our HyperspecI-V1 imaging sensors,  the hypersepectral images can be reconstructed by run the following program in the terminal.

```python
python test_HyperspecI_V1.py
```

The measurements collected using HyperspecI-V1 from the folder  `'./Measurements_Test/HyperspecI_V1/' `  . And output reconstructed hyperspectral  images  will be saved in  `'./Measurements_Test/Output_HyperspecI_V1/' `  .



(2) When the images were collected using our HyperspecI-V2 imaging sensors, the hypersepectral images can be reconstructed by run the following program in the terminal. 

```python
python test_HyperspecI_V2.py 
```

The measurements collected using HyperspecI-V2 from the folder  `'./Measurements_Test/HyperspecI_V2/' `  . And output reconstructed hyperspectral  images  will be saved in  `'./Measurements_Test/Output_HyperspecI_V2/' `  .
